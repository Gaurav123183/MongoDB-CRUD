🧑‍💻 Flask MongoDB CRUD App

A simple web application built using Flask and MongoDB that performs all basic CRUD operations — Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
The app allows users to manage employee records such as name, email, designation, and salary from a single responsive web page.

It uses Bootstrap 5 for a clean and modern interface, and all operations are handled directly within index.html using Flask routes and MongoDB queries.

Perfect for beginners learning how Flask connects with MongoDB to build dynamic web applications.

Tech Used: Flask, PyMongo, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
